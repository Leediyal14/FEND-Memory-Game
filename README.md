## Memory Game Project

   Project 2 for **Google - Udacity FEND Nanodegree Scholarship** Program.


### How the Game Works

   * The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side 

   * The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!


### Instructions

   * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
   * The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
   * If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
   * If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
   * The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


### Game Behavior

   * The player has to finish the game in minimum time duration, to achieve high star rating :star::star::star:

   * Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

   * The timer starts as soon as the game starts and stops when the player completes the game :hourglass:

   * The restart button used to start the game again at any time. The cards get shuffled randomly as player hits restart :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

   * When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating :trophy:


#### Notes

   * The starter project provided by Udacity has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project.
